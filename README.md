# Recursive Tree


It is a list plugin that organizes the records allowing them to be displayed in a hierarchy in the "Tree Files" style. The plugin also allows you to drag and drop the elements of the list, allowing you to reorganize them in a hierarchical way. Allows drag and drop to change the position of items.

## Identified Listing

First, you must configure the plugin by selecting the `Identified List` option, in the Parent field, select the element that will be used as the parent item and then select the order to be followed. The list with the plugin disabled will display the data with all items equally categorized as in the image below:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./.github/1.png" />
</div>

<br />

<p>After configuring and selecting which item will be organized as a parent, the items will be displayed as shown below:  </p>

<div align="center">
 <img src="./.github/3.png" />
</div>

<br />

## Expanded/collapsed listing

<p>For this mode, just activate the Expand/Collapse option and in the Default option select what will be the default display mode when the list is loaded expanded or collapsed as in the following image: </p>
<div align="center">
  <img src="./.github/4.png" />
</div>

<br />

This way it will be possible to collapse or expand the child elements using the `+` icon at the beginning of the list:


<div align="center">
   <img src="./.github/5.png" />
</div>
